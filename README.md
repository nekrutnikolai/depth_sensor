## Low-Cost Depth Sensing Module For Deep-Water Instruments

This project aims to design and develop a low-cost, durable depth-sensing module capable of providing approximate depth readings for underwater instruments submerged up to 2000 meters. Deliverables will include a fully functional prototype, field-tested for real-world integration.
