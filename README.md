### Introduction

This project addresses the challenge of developing a cost-effective depth sensor for intermediate to deep depths (up to 2000 meters). Existing solutions are either prohibitively expensive or unsuitable for these depths. In collaboration with Dr. V. Hunter Adams (Cornell ECE) and Jonathan Pfeifer (WHOI), this effort focuses on creating a robust, affordable sensor module designed for integration with underwater exploration vessels. The sensor balances practical accuracy with resilience to high-pressure underwater environments, supporting WHOI’s marine research with an innovative and accessible solution.
